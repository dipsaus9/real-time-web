# Pong with Socket.io
This project is based on the game Pong. This project will be based on a `express` server and will be using `sockets.io`. More details on this project later.

## Get started
To start this project clone this repo.

When you first start this project run:

`npm run build`

This will build all files from the `src` folder (including images, fonts). If you add files into this folder you may want to run this script again.

To start the server and this project run:

`npm start`

This will start a server on `localhost:1337`. `nodemone` is being used to watch all files and will copy or compile the script when you save them.
