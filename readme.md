# Nudge with Socket.io
This project is based on the old nudge from MSN. This project will be based on a `express` server and will be using `sockets.io`. More details on this project later. The purpose from the application is to send a nudge to a person online. You can watch this preojct on [http://wwww.nodejs.dennisspierenburg.nl](www.nodejs.dennisspierenburg.nl).

## Get started
To start this project clone this repo.

When you first start this project run:

`npm run build`

This will build all files from the `src` folder (including images, fonts). If you add files into this folder you may want to run this script again.

To start the server and this project run:

`npm start`

This will start a server on `localhost:3004`.
This command wil start `nodemon` in the background to watch the files in the src folder. `node-sass` is being used for converting SCSS to CSS.
This project uses some extra commands for devlopment purposes.

I downloaded the mp3 from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_zZHY6x5ik);

## To Do
This project is just getting started. My first goal was creating a room where you can play pong versus someone. This plan didn't work due to time issues. The first part will still stay the same.

- [x] Create a lobby
- [x] View all players online
- [x] Send a player a message (Nudge)
- [x] Create first Node.JS online project
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Send players to a local room
- [ ] Create the game Pong
- [ ] Make it less laggy
- [ ] Cleaning modules

As you can see there is plenty stuff to do. I put a lot of effort into `Node.JS`. I created a lot of new coding styles with Node from this project.
